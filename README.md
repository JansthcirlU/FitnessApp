# FitnessApp

Test project to learn ASP.NET and Angular. Configure fitness routines based on the muscles that you want to train and the exercise equipment that you own.

## Muscles

Muscles are the parts of the body that make any kind of movement happen. Exercising them will make you more athletic.

The human body has been studied very carefully so every muscle is known. This means that you can't define custom muscles, but you can define muscle groups to quickly find the muscles you need.

## Exercises

Choose from a variety of existing exercises to add to your routine, or add custom exercises where you define which muscles are trained and which equipment you need (if any). Define how many repetitions per set and the number of sets to do per session.
